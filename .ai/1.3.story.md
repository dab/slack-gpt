# Story 1.3: Implement Basic Logging Setup

## Story

**As a** Developer\
**I want** a basic, standardized logging configuration\
**so that** application events, errors, and debug information can be captured and monitored effectively, especially when running inside a Docker container.

## Status

Draft

## Context

This story establishes the application's logging strategy. Based on Arch Doc Section 6 (Error Handling) and PRD FR#6, logging should use Python's built-in `logging` module, be configured to output to `stdout`/`stderr` (for Docker compatibility), and use a clear format. This setup might reside in `app/utils/logging_config.py` and be initialized in `app/main.py`.

## Estimation

Story Points: 1

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  - [ ] Python's `logging` module is used.
2.  - [ ] Logging is configured at application startup (e.g., in `app/main.py` or by importing a config module).
3.  - [ ] Logs are directed to `stdout` or `stderr`.
4.  - [ ] A standard log format is used, including timestamp, log level, logger name, and message (e.g., `%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s`).
5.  - [ ] The root logger level is configurable (e.g., via an environment variable `LOG_LEVEL`, defaulting to `INFO`).
6.  - [ ] Other parts of the application can obtain a logger instance (e.g., `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`) and use it to log messages.

## Subtasks

1.  - [ ] Create `app/utils/logging_config.py` (optional, could be in `main.py`).
2.  - [ ] Import the `logging` module.
3.  - [ ] Implement a function (e.g., `setup_logging`) that configures the root logger using `logging.basicConfig` or by creating handlers/formatters.
    *   - [ ] Set the output stream to `sys.stdout`.
    *   - [ ] Define the log format string.
    *   - [ ] Set the logging level based on `os.getenv("LOG_LEVEL", "INFO")`.
4.  - [ ] Call the setup function early in `app/main.py`.
5.  - [ ] Add a sample log message in `app/main.py` (e.g., `logger.info("Application starting...")`) to verify configuration.
6.  - [ ] Verify logs appear in `stdout` when running the application (e.g., via `docker logs`).

## Testing Requirements:

*   Code coverage requirement >= 70% for `app/services/`.
