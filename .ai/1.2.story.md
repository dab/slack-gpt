# Story 1.2: Implement Configuration Loading

## Story

**As a** Developer\
**I want** the application to securely load configuration values from environment variables\
**so that** secrets are not hardcoded, configuration is flexible across environments (dev, prod), and the app adheres to security best practices.

## Status

Complete

## Context

This story focuses on implementing the configuration loading mechanism using `python-dotenv` for local development (reading `.env`) and standard `os.getenv` for accessing environment variables provided by the OS or Docker runtime. This is crucial for accessing Slack tokens, OpenAI keys, Redis details, and the PDF path securely, as mandated by Arch Doc Section 6 (Config Management) and Section 10 (Security). This functionality will likely be integrated into `app/main.py` or a dedicated `app/utils/config.py`.

## Estimation

Story Points: 1

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  - [x] `python-dotenv` is included in `requirements.txt`.
2.  - [x] At application startup (e.g., top of `app/utils/config.py`), `dotenv.load_dotenv()` is called to load variables from `.env` if it exists.
3.  - [x] All required configuration values (`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`, `PDF_DATA_DIR`) are accessed using `os.getenv("VARIABLE_NAME")`.
4.  - [x] Appropriate error handling or default values are considered for optional variables, although for MVP, most are likely required.
5.  - [x] Secrets (tokens, keys, passwords) are never logged or hardcoded in the source code.

## Subtasks

1.  - [x] Ensure `python-dotenv` is in `requirements.txt`.
2.  - [x] Add `from dotenv import load_dotenv` and `import os` to the relevant Python file (`app/utils/config.py`).
3.  - [x] Call `load_dotenv()` early in the application startup sequence (`app/utils/config.py`).
4.  - [x] Replace any placeholder values for configuration with `os.getenv("VARIABLE_NAME")` where configuration is needed (`app/utils/config.py`, `app/main.py`).
5.  - [x] Verify that the application still runs correctly when configuration is provided via environment variables (Verified via successful Docker container start and OAuth flow completion).

## Testing Requirements:

*   Code coverage requirement >= 70% for `app/services/`.
