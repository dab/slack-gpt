# Story 0.5: Configure Slack Request URL

## Story

**As a** Project Setup User\
**I want** to configure the Slack App's Request URL\
**so that** Slack can send slash command invocations and events to the running application container.

## Status

Draft

## Context

This is the final manual setup step, connecting the Slack App configuration to the running application instance (verified in Story 0.4). For local development, this typically involves using a tunneling service like `ngrok` to expose the local container port publicly. For deployed environments, this would be the public URL of the deployment. Refer to Arch Doc Section 4, Step 7.

## Estimation

Story Points: 0 (Manual User Task)

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  - [ ] A public HTTPS endpoint for the running application container is available (e.g., via `ngrok http 3000` or deployment URL).
2.  - [ ] The Request URL for the `/ask` command in the Slack App configuration ("Features" -> "Slash Commands") is set to `<public_endpoint>/slack/events`.
3.  - [ ] The Request URL for the `/help` command in the Slack App configuration is set to `<public_endpoint>/slack/events`.
4.  - [ ] (If applicable) The Request URL under "Event Subscriptions" is set correctly if needed for future features.

## Subtasks

1.  - [ ] If running locally, start `ngrok` (or similar) to expose the container's port (e.g., 3000). Note the HTTPS URL.
2.  - [ ] Navigate to the Slack App configuration page.
3.  - [ ] Go to "Slash Commands" and update the Request URL for `/ask` and `/help`.
4.  - [ ] Save the changes in the Slack App configuration.
