# Story 0.3: Populate Knowledge Base Directory

## Story

**As a** Project Setup User\
**I want** to place relevant PDF documents into the designated data directory\
**so that** the application has a knowledge base to query when answering `/ask` commands.

## Status

Draft

## Context

This story covers populating the local directory with the source material for the bot's knowledge. The location of this directory is configured via the `PDF_DATA_DIR` environment variable (set in Story 0.2). This directory will be mounted into the Docker container (Story 0.4) so the `Knowledge Base Service` (Story 2.3) can access the files. See Arch Doc Section 3.3 (Data View) and Section 3.4 (Deployment View).

## Estimation

Story Points: 0 (Manual User Task)

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  - [ ] The directory specified by `PDF_DATA_DIR` in the `.env` file exists.
2.  - [ ] One or more relevant PDF documents are placed inside this directory.

## Subtasks

1.  - [ ] Create the directory (e.g., `mkdir -p ./data/company_docs/` if `PDF_DATA_DIR=./data/company_docs/`).
2.  - [ ] Copy or move PDF files into this directory.
