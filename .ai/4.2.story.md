# Story 4.2: Finalize README Documentation

## Story

**As a** Developer\
**I want** to update and finalize the `README.md` file\
**so that** users have comprehensive, accurate instructions for setting up, configuring, building, running, and using the Slack GPT-Assistant.

## Status

Draft

## Context

This story ensures the project's primary documentation (`README.md`) is complete and reflects the final state of the MVP implementation. It should consolidate information from the PRD (Story 0 requirements) and the Architecture Document (Section 4, Manual Steps), incorporating details confirmed during development.

## Estimation

Story Points: 2

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  - [ ] `README.md` exists at the project root.
2.  - [ ] Includes a clear Project Overview section explaining the bot's purpose.
3.  - [ ] Includes a Prerequisites section (Python 3.11, Docker, ngrok for local dev).
4.  - [ ] Includes detailed Setup instructions:
    *   - [ ] Cloning the repository.
    *   - [ ] Creating and populating the `.env` file (referencing `.env.example`). Lists all required variables.
    *   - [ ] Placing PDF documents into the configured `PDF_DATA_DIR`.
5.  - [ ] Includes clear Build instructions (`docker build -t slack-gpt-assistant .`).
6.  - [ ] Includes clear Run instructions (`docker run ...` specifying port mapping, `--env-file .env`, and volume mounting for `/app/data`, using the correct image tag).
7.  - [ ] Includes instructions on how to configure the Slack App Request URL, mentioning `ngrok` for local development (referencing the port exposed by Docker).
8.  - [ ] Includes a Usage section explaining how to use the `/ask <question>` and `/help` commands in Slack.
9.  - [ ] Information is accurate and reflects the implemented code and configuration.
10. - [ ] Formatting uses Markdown effectively for readability.

## Subtasks

1.  - [ ] Review the existing `README.md` (if any).
2.  - [ ] Draft or update the Project Overview.
3.  - [ ] Draft or update the Prerequisites section.
4.  - [ ] Draft or update the Setup section, ensuring all manual steps from Arch Doc Sec 4 / PRD Story 0 are covered clearly. Emphasize `.env` population and PDF placement.
5.  - [ ] Draft or update the Build section with the correct `docker build` command.
6.  - [ ] Draft or update the Run section with the correct `docker run` command, explaining flags like `-p`, `--env-file`, `-v`.
7.  - [ ] Draft or update the Slack Configuration section explaining Request URL setup and `ngrok`.
8.  - [ ] Draft or update the Usage section with examples for `/ask` and `/help`.
9.  - [ ] Review the entire document for accuracy, clarity, and completeness based on the final MVP state.
10. - [ ] Format using Markdown (headings, code blocks, lists).
