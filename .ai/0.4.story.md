# Story 0.4: Verify Initial Docker Build & Run Capability

## Story

**As a** Project Setup User\
**I want** to build the initial Docker image and run a basic container\
**so that** the fundamental containerization setup, environment variable sourcing, and volume mounting are verified early.

## Status

Draft

## Context

This story ensures the basic Docker setup (defined in Story 1.1's `Dockerfile`) works correctly with the local environment (`.env` from Story 0.2) and data (`data/` from Story 0.3). It's a verification step confirming that the core components can be packaged and run, even if the application logic is minimal at this stage. Refer to Arch Doc Section 3.4 (Deployment View) and Section 4, Step 6.

## Estimation

Story Points: 0 (Manual User Task, depends on Story 1.1)

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  - [ ] `docker build -t slack-gpt-assistant .` command completes successfully using the `Dockerfile` created in Story 1.1.
2.  - [ ] `docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data --name slack-bot slack-gpt-assistant` command starts the container without immediate errors. (Adjust volume source path and port as needed).
3.  - [ ] Container logs (viewed via `docker logs slack-bot`) show the application starting up (e.g., `uvicorn` running) based on the minimal app from Story 1.1.
4.  - [ ] The container successfully reads environment variables from the `.env` file.
5.  - [ ] The `/app/data` directory inside the container correctly reflects the contents of the host's `PDF_DATA_DIR`.

## Subtasks

1.  - [ ] Execute the `docker build` command.
2.  - [ ] Execute the `docker run` command with correct parameters for port mapping, environment file, and volume mounting.
3.  - [ ] Check container logs using `docker logs`.
4.  - [ ] (Optional) Use `docker exec -it slack-bot sh` to inspect the running container's environment (`printenv`) and filesystem (`ls /app/data`).
