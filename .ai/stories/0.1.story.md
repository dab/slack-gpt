# Story 0.1: Obtain External Credentials

## Story

**As a** Project Setup User\
**I want** to obtain credentials for Slack, OpenAI, and Redis\
**so that** the application has the necessary access tokens and connection details to interact with external services.

## Status

Completed

## Context

This story covers the manual, external steps required before the application can be configured or run. It involves interacting with the Slack API website, OpenAI platform, and provisioning a Redis instance. These credentials (`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`) are prerequisites for Story 0.2 (Environment Setup). Refer to Arch Doc Section 4 for detailed steps required from the user.

## Estimation

Story Points: 0 (Manual User Task)

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  - [x] Slack App created and configured with `/ask`, `/help` commands and necessary permissions (`commands`, `chat:write`).
2.  - [x] Slack Bot Token (`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`) obtained.
3.  - [x] Slack Signing Secret (`SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`) obtained.
4.  - [x] OpenAI API Key (`OPENAI_API_KEY`) obtained.
5.  - [x] Redis instance provisioned (local or cloud).
6.  - [x] Redis Host (`REDIS_HOST`), Port (`REDIS_PORT`), and Password (`REDIS_PASSWORD`) obtained. Redis MUST be configured to require authentication.

## Subtasks

1.  - [x] Follow Slack documentation to create an app, configure slash commands, and install it.
2.  - [x] Note down the Slack Bot Token and Signing Secret.
3.  - [x] Follow OpenAI documentation to obtain an API Key.
4.  - [x] Provision a Redis instance (e.g., run `docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --requirepass yourpassword redis` locally or use a cloud provider).
5.  - [x] Note down Redis connection details.
