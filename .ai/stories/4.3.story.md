# Story 4.3: Log and Echo User Queries with Bot Responses

## Story

**As a** SlackGPT user and administrator  
**I want** the bot to log all user queries and echo the user's original question alongside the bot's response in Slack  
**so that** I can track user interactions for analytics, debugging, and provide better context in conversations.

## Status

- Approved

## Context

Currently, when a user submits a question via the `/ask` command, only the bot's response is visible in the chat, and the user's original query is not shown. This can cause confusion for users and makes it difficult to track which question the bot is answering, especially in busy channels or threads. Additionally, logging user queries is important for analytics, auditing, and improving the bot's performance. This story aims to enhance transparency and traceability by ensuring both the user's question and the bot's answer are visible in the chat, and that all queries are logged as per the PRD's analytics requirements.

## Estimation

Story Points: 2

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [x] The bot MUST log every user query received via the `/ask` command, including the user ID, timestamp, and question text.
2. - [x] The bot MUST echo the user's original question in the bot's response message in Slack, formatted for clarity.
3. - [x] The bot's response MUST use Slack Block Kit for formatting.
4. - [x] The logging MUST not expose sensitive information (e.g., API keys).
5. - [x] The feature MUST be covered by manual or automated tests as appropriate.

## Subtasks

1. - [x] Update `/ask` command handler to log user queries with metadata (user ID, timestamp, question).
   1. - [x] Add logging logic to the handler.
   2. - [x] Ensure logs are written to stdout/stderr for Docker compatibility.
2. - [x] Update bot response logic to include the user's original question in the reply.
   1. - [x] Format the response using Slack Block Kit.
   2. - [x] Test the response in Slack to ensure clarity and usability.
3. - [x] Review and update documentation as needed.

## Testing Requirements:**

    - Manual testing to verify that user queries are logged and echoed in Slack responses.
    - Automated tests for handler logic were added and all tests pass.
