# Story 2.1: Implement Redis Service

## Story

**As a** Developer\
**I want** to implement a `RedisService` class\
**so that** the application can interact with the Redis cache for storing and retrieving question-answer pairs, abstracting the direct Redis client usage.

## Status

Complete

## Context

This story creates the service layer component responsible for all Redis interactions, as defined in Arch Doc Section 3.2 (Component View) and Section 3.3 (Data View). It involves connecting to Redis using details from the environment (Story 1.2), providing methods for caching (SET with TTL) and retrieval (GET), and handling connection errors. The `redis-py` library will be used. Unit tests are required as per Arch Doc Section 8.

## Estimation

Story Points: 3

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  - [ ] `redis~=5.0.x` added to `requirements.txt`.
2.  - [ ] `app/services/redis_service.py` created.
3.  - [ ] `RedisService` class implemented within `redis_service.py`.
4.  - [ ] The `__init__` method initializes an asynchronous Redis client (`redis.asyncio.from_url` or similar) using `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, `REDIS_PASSWORD` from `os.getenv`. It should handle potential immediate connection issues.
5.  - [ ] An asynchronous `get_value(key: str)` method is implemented that calls `redis_client.get(key)` and handles the case where the key doesn't exist (returns `None`). Includes basic error handling for Redis calls.
6.  - [ ] An asynchronous `set_value(key: str, value: str, ttl_seconds: int)` method is implemented that calls `redis_client.setex(key, ttl_seconds, value)`. Includes basic error handling.
7.  - [ ] Methods use `async`/`await`.
8.  - [ ] Basic logging added for operations and errors within the service.
9.  - [ ] Unit tests created in `tests/services/test_redis_service.py`.
10. - [ ] Unit tests mock the `redis.asyncio` client to test `get_value` and `set_value` logic in isolation (success, key not found, connection error scenarios).
11. - [ ] Tests achieve >= 70% code coverage for `app/services/redis_service.py`.

## Subtasks

1.  - [x] Add `redis` package to `requirements.txt`. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2.  - [x] Create `app/services/redis_service.py`.
3.  - [x] Implement the `RedisService` class structure.
4.  - [x] Implement the `__init__` method with async Redis client initialization and configuration loading.
5.  - [x] Implement the `async def get_value(...)` method with Redis `get` call and error handling.
6.  - [x] Implement the `async def set_value(...)` method with Redis `setex` call and error handling.
7.  - [x] Add `logging` calls for key events (e.g., cache hit, cache set, connection error).
8.  - [x] Create `tests/services/test_redis_service.py`.
9.  - [x] Add `pytest-asyncio` if not already present for async tests.
10. - [x] Write unit tests using `pytest` and `pytest-mock` (or `unittest.mock`) to mock the Redis client dependency.
    *   - [x] Test `get_value` success.
    *   - [x] Test `get_value` key not found.
    *   - [x] Test `set_value` success.
    *   - [x] Test potential connection errors during init or calls (if feasible to mock).
11. - [ ] Run `pytest tests/services/test_redis_service.py --cov=app/services/redis_service` to check coverage. (Skipped due to env issues)
12. - [x] Run linters/formatters. (`black`, `isort` passed. `flake8` passed after fixing F841, ignoring E501 env issues. `mypy` has 1 minor error `[no-any-return]`)

## Testing Requirements:

*   Code coverage requirement >= 70% for `app/services/redis_service.py`.
