# Story 2.2: Implement OpenAI Service

## Story

**As a** Developer\
**I want** to implement an `OpenAIService` class\
**so that** the application can interact with the OpenAI API (`gpt-4o-mini`) to generate answers based on user questions and provided context, abstracting the API client usage.

## Status

In Progress

## Context

This story creates the service layer component responsible for all OpenAI API interactions, as outlined in Arch Doc Section 3.2 (Component View). It involves initializing the OpenAI client using the API key from the environment (Story 1.2), formatting prompts, calling the specified model (`gpt-4o-mini`), handling responses, and managing API errors. The `openai` library will be used. Unit tests are required per Arch Doc Section 8.

## Estimation

Story Points: 3

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  - [x] `openai~=1.x` added to `requirements.txt`.
2.  - [x] `app/services/openai_service.py` created.
3.  - [x] `OpenAIService` class implemented within `openai_service.py`.
4.  - [x] The `__init__` method initializes an asynchronous OpenAI client (`openai.AsyncOpenAI`) using the `OPENAI_API_KEY` from `os.getenv`.
5.  - [x] An asynchronous `get_answer(question: str, context: str)` method is implemented.
6.  - [x] The `get_answer` method constructs a suitable prompt using the provided `question` and `context` (e.g., a system message setting the role, and a user message containing context and question).
7.  - [x] The `get_answer` method calls the OpenAI completions API (`client.chat.completions.create`) using the `gpt-4o-mini` model, the constructed prompt, and appropriate parameters (e.g., `max_tokens`, `temperature`).
8.  - [x] The method extracts the answer content from the API response.
9.  - [x] The method includes error handling for OpenAI API errors (e.g., rate limits, authentication issues, server errors) using `try...except` around the API call, logging errors and returning `None` or raising a specific exception.
10. - [x] Methods use `async`/`await`.
11. - [x] Basic logging added for API call initiation, success, and failure.
12. - [x] Unit tests created in `tests/services/test_openai_service.py`.
13. - [x] Unit tests mock the `openai.AsyncOpenAI` client and its `chat.completions.create` method to test `get_answer` logic (success, API error scenarios) without making real API calls.
14. - [x] Tests achieve >= 70% code coverage for `app/services/openai_service.py`.

## Subtasks

1.  - [x] Add `openai` package to `requirements.txt`. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2.  - [x] Create `app/services/openai_service.py`.
3.  - [x] Implement the `OpenAIService` class structure.
4.  - [x] Implement the `__init__` method with async OpenAI client initialization using the API key.
5.  - [x] Implement the `async def get_answer(...)` method.
    *   - [x] Define prompt structure (system message, user message with context/question).
    *   - [x] Call `client.chat.completions.create` with model `gpt-4o-mini` and prompt.
    *   - [x] Extract content from the response (e.g., `response.choices[0].message.content`).
    *   - [x] Add `try...except` block for `openai` exceptions.
6.  - [x] Add `logging` calls for key events (API call start, success, failure details).
7.  - [x] Create `tests/services/test_openai_service.py`.
8.  - [x] Write unit tests using `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, and mocking for the OpenAI client.
    *   - [x] Test successful response parsing.
    *   - [x] Test handling of simulated API errors (e.g., raising `openai.APIError`).
    *   - [x] Test handling of a generic exception scenario.
9.  - [x] Run `pytest tests/services/test_openai_service.py --cov=app/services/openai_service` to check coverage.
10. - [x] Run linters/formatters.

## Testing Requirements:

*   Code coverage requirement >= 70% for `app/services/openai_service.py`.

## Story Wrap Up (To be filled in AFTER agent execution):
