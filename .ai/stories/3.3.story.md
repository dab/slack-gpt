# Story 3.3: Implement `/ask` Command Handler - Error Handling & Not Found

## Story

**As a** Developer\
**I want** the `/ask` command handler to gracefully handle errors from services and situations where no answer is found\
**so that** the user receives clear feedback instead of cryptic errors or silence, and the application remains robust.

## Status

Complete

## Context

This story complements Story 3.2 by adding the necessary error handling and specific "not found" logic required by PRD FR#5 and Arch Doc Section 6 (Error Handling). It involves adding `try...except` blocks around service calls within the `/ask` handler, checking for failure indicators (like `None` return values), and sending specific, user-friendly Block Kit messages via `respond()` for different failure scenarios (Redis unavailable during cache set, OpenAI API failure, answer not found).

## Estimation

Story Points: 2

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  - [ ] The `/ask` handler function (`handle_ask_command` in `ask_command.py`) includes `try...except` blocks around calls to `KnowledgeBaseService`, `RedisService`, and `OpenAIService`.
2.  - [ ] If `RedisService.get_value` raises an exception (e.g., connection error), the error is logged, and the flow proceeds as a cache miss (attempting KB/OpenAI).
3.  - [ ] If `RedisService.set_value` raises an exception after a successful OpenAI response, the error is logged, but the answer is still sent to the user via `respond()`.
4.  - [ ] If `KnowledgeBaseService.find_relevant_context` raises an unexpected exception, it's logged, and a generic error message is sent via `respond()`.
5.  - [ ] If `OpenAIService.get_answer` returns `None` or raises an exception:
    *   - [ ] The specific technical error is logged (OpenAI API failure logged).
    *   - [ ] A user-friendly error message ("Sorry, I'm having trouble connecting to my brain...") is formatted using Block Kit and sent via `respond()`.
6.  - [ ] If `OpenAIService.get_answer` returns a valid response, but the response indicates no answer could be determined (or if `find_relevant_context` returns no useful context), the handler should detect this.
7.  - [ ] In the "not found" case (Criteria 6), a specific message ("I couldn't find a specific answer...") is formatted using Block Kit and sent via `respond()` (Answer sent: not_found logged).
8.  - [ ] User-facing error messages use Block Kit and avoid technical jargon (PRD UXR#1, UXR#2).

## Subtasks

1.  - [x] Add `try...except` around `redis_service.get_value` call. Log exception and proceed.
2.  - [x] Add `try...except` around `redis_service.set_value` call. Log exception but don't prevent sending the answer.
3.  - [x] Add `try...except` around `knowledge_base_service.find_relevant_context` call. Log exception and `await respond(blocks=generic_error_blocks)`.
4.  - [x] Add `try...except` around `openai_service.get_answer` call.
    *   - [x] In `except`: Log exception and `await respond(blocks=openai_error_blocks)`.
5.  - [x] Check the result of `openai_service.get_answer`. If it's `None` (explicitly returned on error/not-found by service implementation):
    *   - [x] `await respond(blocks=not_found_blocks)`.
6.  - [x] Define Block Kit structures for `generic_error_blocks`, `openai_error_blocks`, and `not_found_blocks`. Ensure they are user-friendly.
7.  - [x] Manually test error conditions (e.g., stop Redis, provide invalid OpenAI key temporarily, ask questions guaranteed to yield no context/answer) to verify error messages.

## Testing Requirements:

*   Code coverage requirement >= 70% for `app/services/`. (Handler testing with mocked services throwing errors recommended post-MVP).
