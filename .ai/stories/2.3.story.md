# Story 2.3: Implement Knowledge Base Service (PDF Processing)

## Story

**As a** Developer\
**I want** to implement a `KnowledgeBaseService` class\
**so that** the application can scan a directory for PDFs, extract their text content using `PyMuPDF`, and find text chunks relevant to a user's question to provide context for the OpenAI service.

## Status

In Progress

## Context

This story creates the service responsible for interacting with the local PDF knowledge base, as defined in Arch Doc Section 3.2 (Component View) and Section 3.3 (Data View). It involves file system operations (scanning the configured `PDF_DATA_DIR`), PDF text extraction (`PyMuPDF`), and a basic text retrieval mechanism (simple keyword matching for MVP). Given PDF processing can be CPU-intensive, consider using `asyncio.to_thread` if initial tests show blocking. Unit tests are required (Arch Doc Section 8).

## Estimation

Story Points: 4

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  - [x] `PyMuPDF~=1.24.x` added to `requirements.txt`.
2.  - [x] `app/services/knowledge_base.py` created.
3.  - [x] `KnowledgeBaseService` class implemented.
4.  - [x] The `__init__` method takes the `pdf_data_dir` path (from config) and validates it. It might optionally pre-scan PDFs.
5.  - [x] A method (`_scan_pdf_files`) exists to find all `.pdf` files within the configured directory.
6.  - [x] A method (`_extract_text_from_pdf`) exists that uses `fitz.open(pdf_path)` to extract full text content, with error handling.
7.  - [x] An asynchronous method `find_relevant_context(question: str)` is implemented:
    *   - [x] It iterates through all found PDF files.
    *   - [x] For each PDF, it extracts the text (using the `_extract_text_from_pdf` method) with caching.
    *   - [x] It implements a basic search strategy on the extracted text (split into chunks, keyword matching, up to token limit).
    *   - [x] It handles errors gracefully (logs issues and continues).
    *   - [x] Blocking calls are wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread`.
8.  - [x] Basic logging added for file scanning, text extraction, context finding, and errors.
9.  - [x] Unit tests created in `tests/services/test_knowledge_base.py`.
10. - [x] Unit tests mock filesystem operations and `fitz.open` / `page.get_text` calls to test logic and error handling.
11. - [x] Tests achieve >= 70% code coverage for `app/services/knowledge_base.py`.

## Subtasks

1.  - [x] Add `PyMuPDF` package to `requirements.txt`. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2.  - [x] Create `app/services/knowledge_base.py`.
3.  - [x] Implement the `KnowledgeBaseService` class structure.
4.  - [x] Implement `__init__` taking `pdf_data_dir` path from config.
5.  - [x] Implement helper method `_scan_pdf_files`.
6.  - [x] Implement helper method `_extract_text_from_pdf` using `PyMuPDF`. Include basic error handling.
7.  - [x] Implement `async def find_relevant_context(question: str)` method with chunking and keyword matching, wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread`.
8.  - [x] Add logging calls.
9.  - [x] Create `tests/services/test_knowledge_base.py`.
10. - [x] Write unit tests for: finding files, text extraction mock, context retrieval logic, error handling.
11. - [x] Run `pytest tests/services/test_knowledge_base.py --cov=app/services/knowledge_base` to check coverage.
12. - [x] Run linters/formatters.
