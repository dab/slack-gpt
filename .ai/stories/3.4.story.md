# Story 3.4: Implement Analytics Logging Points

## Story

**As a** Developer\
**I want** to integrate structured logging calls at key points in the application flow\
**so that** bot activity, performance, and errors can be tracked and analyzed based on PRD FR#6 requirements.

## Status
Complete

## Context

This story focuses on adding the specific log messages required by the PRD for analytics and monitoring purposes. It leverages the logging setup from Story 1.3. Log calls should be added within the command handlers (`ask_command.py`, `help_command.py`) and potentially within the services (`redis_service.py`, `openai_service.py`, `knowledge_base.py`) to capture the specified events. Logs should go to `stdout`/`stderr`.

## Estimation

Story Points: 2

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  - [X] Logging instances (`logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`) are obtained in relevant handlers and services.
2.  - [X] Log message added when `/ask` command is received (include a non-sensitive request identifier if possible, e.g., hash of question or Slack's event ID).
3.  - [X] Log message added for cache check result (hit or miss).
4.  - [X] Log message added when PDF search via `KnowledgeBaseService` is performed.
5.  - [X] Log messages added when `OpenAIService` API call is initiated, completed successfully, or failed.
6.  - [X] Log message added when the final answer is sent (indicating success, failure, or "not_found").
7.  - [X] Log messages added for Redis connection errors (likely within `RedisService` error handling).
8.  - [X] Log messages use appropriate levels (e.g., `INFO` for standard events, `ERROR` for failures).
9.  - [X] Logs are written to `stdout`/`stderr` as configured in Story 1.3.
10. - [X] Logs avoid including raw sensitive data like API keys or full user questions (use hashes or identifiers where appropriate).

## Subtasks

1.  - [X] Ensure `import logging` and `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` are present in `ask_command.py`, `help_command.py`, `redis_service.py`, `openai_service.py`, `knowledge_base.py`.
2.  - [X] In `handle_ask_command`:
    *   - [X] Log `INFO` "Received /ask command" (with identifier).
    *   - [X] Log `INFO` "Cache hit for key: {cache_key}" or "Cache miss for key: {cache_key}".
    *   - [X] Log `INFO` "Performing PDF search..." (Moved inside KB Service).
    *   - [X] Log `INFO` "Calling OpenAI API..." (Moved inside OpenAI Service).
    *   - [X] Log `INFO` "OpenAI call successful." or `ERROR` "OpenAI call failed." (Maybe move inside OpenAI Service)
    *   - [X] Log `INFO` "Sending answer (source: {cache/openai/not_found})."
3.  - [X] In `handle_help_command`: Log `INFO` "Received /help command".
4.  - [X] In `RedisService`: Log `ERROR` during connection issues or failed operations.
5.  - [X] In `OpenAIService`: Log `ERROR` on API call failures.
6.  - [X] In `KnowledgeBaseService`: Log `INFO` when starting search, `ERROR` on file processing issues.
7.  - [X] Review all log messages for clarity and ensure no sensitive data is leaked.
8.  - [ ] Run the application and trigger `/ask` (cache miss, hit), `/help`, and error conditions; verify logs appear correctly in `docker logs`.

## Testing Requirements:

*   Code coverage requirement >= 70% for `app/services/`.
