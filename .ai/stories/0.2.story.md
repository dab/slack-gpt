# Story 0.2: Set Up Local Repository & Environment File

## Story

**As a** Project Setup User\
**I want** to clone the repository and populate a `.env` file with credentials and configuration\
**so that** the application can be configured correctly for local execution or Docker build.

## Status

Completed

## Context

This story covers the initial local setup of the project after cloning. It bridges the gap between obtaining external credentials (Story 0.1) and running the application. The `.env` file is crucial for providing configuration without hardcoding secrets, as specified in Arch Doc Section 6 (Config Management) and Section 10 (Credentials Management). An `.env.example` file should guide this process (created in Story 1.1).

## Estimation

Story Points: 0 (Manual User Task, depends on Story 1.1 providing `.env.example`)

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  - [x] Project Git repository cloned locally.
2.  - [x] `.env` file created by copying `.env.example`.
3.  - [x] `.env` file populated with valid credentials obtained in Story 0.1:
    *   - [x] `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`
    *   - [x] `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`
    *   - [x] `OPENAI_API_KEY`
    *   - [x] `REDIS_HOST`
    *   - [x] `REDIS_PORT`
    *   - [x] `REDIS_PASSWORD`
4.  - [x] `PDF_DATA_DIR` variable set in `.env` to the correct *relative path* where PDF documents will be stored (e.g., `./data/company_docs/`).

## Subtasks

1.  - [x] `git clone <repository_url>`
2.  - [x] `cp .env.example .env`
3.  - [x] Edit `.env` and fill in all variable values.
