# Story 4.1: Optimize Dockerfile

## Story

**As a** Developer\
**I want** to optimize the `Dockerfile`\
**so that** the resulting Docker image is smaller, builds faster, and follows containerization best practices.

## Status

In Progress

## Context

This story refines the initial `Dockerfile` created in Story 1.1. Optimizations can include using multi-stage builds (separating build dependencies from runtime), ensuring efficient layer caching (ordering commands correctly), running as a non-root user, and cleaning up unnecessary files. Refer to Arch Doc Section 3.4 and standard Docker best practices.

## Estimation

Story Points: 1.5

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  - [ ] `Dockerfile` is reviewed against best practices.
2.  - [ ] Multi-stage build is implemented:
    *   - [ ] A `builder` stage installs dependencies (including dev dependencies if needed for compilation).
    *   - [ ] A final runtime stage uses a slim Python base image.
    *   - [ ] Only necessary application code and runtime dependencies are copied from the `builder` stage to the final stage.
3.  - [ ] Layer caching is optimized (e.g., copy `requirements.txt` and install before copying application code).
4.  - [ ] A non-root user is created and used to run the application (`USER` instruction). Necessary file permissions adjusted.
5.  - [ ] Unnecessary files or build artifacts are excluded or removed.
6.  - [ ] The `Dockerfile` correctly exposes the required port (e.g., 3000).
7.  - [ ] The optimized `Dockerfile` still successfully builds (`docker build`) and runs (`docker run` from Story 0.4) the application.

## Subtasks

1.  - [x] Analyze the current `Dockerfile` from Story 1.1.
2.  - [x] Restructure into a multi-stage build (`FROM ... AS builder`, `FROM ...`).
3.  - [x] Optimize `COPY` and `RUN` command order for layer caching.
4.  - [x] Add instructions to create a non-root user/group (`RUN groupadd ... && useradd ...`).
5.  - [x] Add `USER` instruction before the final `CMD`.
6.  - [x] Ensure file ownership/permissions allow the non-root user to run the app and access necessary directories (like `/app`).
7.  - [x] Verify port exposure (`EXPOSE`).
8.  - [x] Add `--no-cache-dir` to `pip install` commands.
9.  - [x] Re-build the image (`docker build`) and verify reduced size (optional).
10. - [ ] Re-run the container (`docker run`) and verify the application starts and operates correctly as the non-root user.

## Testing Requirements:

*   Code coverage requirement >= 70% for `app/services/`.
