# Story 3.1: Implement `/help` Command Handler

## Story

**As a** Developer\
**I want** to implement the `/help` slash command handler\
**so that** users can get basic information about the bot and how to use it.

## Status

Draft

## Context

This story implements one of the two core user-facing commands defined in PRD FR#2. It involves creating a handler function in `app/handlers/help_command.py`, registering it with the Bolt app in `app/main.py`, and crafting a response using Slack Block Kit for good formatting (as per PRD UXR#1). This is a relatively simple, synchronous command handler.

## Estimation

Story Points: 1

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  - [ ] `app/handlers/help_command.py` created.
2.  - [ ] A handler function (e.g., `handle_help_command`) is implemented in `help_command.py`.
3.  - [ ] The handler function is registered with the Bolt `app` instance in `app/main.py` using `@app.command("/help")`.
4.  - [ ] The handler function returns or calls `ack()` with a response payload.
5.  - [ ] The response payload uses Slack Block Kit (e.g., `blocks=[...]`) to format the help message.
6.  - [ ] The help message clearly explains the bot's purpose and the syntax for the `/ask <question>` command.
7.  - [ ] The response is sent synchronously (within the `ack()`).

## Subtasks

1.  - [ ] Create `app/handlers/help_command.py`.
2.  - [ ] Define the `handle_help_command(ack, command, logger)` function signature (or similar based on Bolt).
3.  - [ ] Import necessary Bolt components (`ack`).
4.  - [ ] Construct the help message string/content.
5.  - [ ] Create the Block Kit JSON structure for the help message (e.g., using Section blocks with markdown text).
6.  - [ ] Call `await ack(blocks=...)` or `ack(blocks=...)` depending on async context (likely sync here).
7.  - [ ] In `app/main.py`, import the handler function (`from app.handlers.help_command import handle_help_command`).
8.  - [ ] Register the command using the `@app.command("/help")` decorator above the imported handler reference (or directly on the function if defined in `main.py`).
9.  - [ ] Manually test the `/help` command in Slack after running the application.

## Testing Requirements:

*   Code coverage requirement >= 70% for `app/services/`. (No service interaction here, but handler testing could be added later).
